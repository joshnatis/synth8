I built this! The synth is a project for my Embedded Systems course -- you can read the [paper](https://github.com/joshnatis/synth8/blob/main/paper/synth8.pdf) for more information (and by more information I mean I wrote 10 pages, so srsly). The beautiful case was made by Ilia (within a few hours...), and the audio signal generating library is by Dzl TheEvilGenius (find the source code [here](https://github.com/dzlonline/the_synth)).
